# The Dark Prince: Synthesis helper

Launched on december 1st in 2023, **Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince** contains amazing possibilities to combine monsters and create new ones. 

That website will contains a lot of different tools to help players to quickly **find the right combinations** and **locate the necessary resources and monsters**.

## Content / Tools

### Monster collection
Players might be able to obtain information on every monsters of the game. Thoses datas will be showed as a library / collection of monsters with sheets for every monster. That tool will be connected to the [Search and filter](#search-and-filter) tool.

Every monster will have the following **information displayed** :
- Name
- Game id
- Location with season and/or obtention ways (events, quests)
- Family
- Rank (G to X)
- Statistics (Ex: Strength, wisdom; from 0 to 5)
- Combinations (Classic)
- Combinations (Special)

### Synthesis paths
The synthesis paths or "combinations" tool will be showed inside every monster sheet. 

A lot of monsters can be created by **combining two to four monsters**. There is currently two methods to synthesize monsters.

#### Classic combination
*I'm currently in need of more informations about it.*

#### Special combination
In The Dark Prince, the developers added a new way to synthesize monster : **the special combination**.
*I'm currently in need of more informations about it.*

Both combinations methods will **show the parents / monsters** required in order to create the desired monster. <br />
Informations: Pictures and names. Pictures will redirect to the parent sheet.

**Optionnal** yet useful functionality: being able to click on a parent to quickly display one of its combinations instead of its sheet. Players could reach the parent sheet by clicking on the name area. 

*Note: some monsters cannot be synthesized while some has many combinations paths.*

### Locator

### Additional tools
Tools that could be used later but aren't a priority : 
- Boss guides
- Stat Ranking

*Note: the project could evolve depending of reviews and useful ideas. (Such an evidence)*
